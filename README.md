# Crow - a Crossword model in Haskell

When I search for "haskell crossword", the top hit for me is 
a [blog post I wrote more than 7 years ago](http://greenokapi.net/blog/2008/12/18/crossword-puzzles-in-haskell/)
where I wrote:

I'd tried it in Javascript, Java, and Perl several times.  I'm not sure how
many years, but it's entirely possible that I've been at this for 15 years.

This is the latest iteration.  (Currently just a model, intention is to turn
this into a web-playable crossword.) Advice and contributions are welcome to
help me take less than another 15 years to finish it this time.

# Installation

This is a `stack` project, so (I think) you should be able to simply run
`stack test` or `stack repl` in it.
